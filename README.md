# Python-Prelims

This program is the prelim exam in our Python course.

We were tasked to make a program which has a maximum of 
3 tries to login using the set username and password. 

Upon entering the program, the user will be asked to input
a word wherein the vowels will be separated with spaces and
consonants will be separated with hypens.
